# How To Use the Vuforia Web Services

The Vuforia Web Services  enables you to query, upload, and manage images in Cloud Databases and to obtain reports on your targets and databases using a REST based API via HTTP.

Documentation inside the project explains how to use the VWS API to perform various types of operations. For managing Cloud DB targets using the VWS API, you will need to use the Server Access Keys associated to your Cloud DB.

# Scene setup

In order to access VWS API commands, create a gameobject in your scene with VWS component attached.
VWS component public field AccessKey and SecretKey must be specified for successful authentication.
